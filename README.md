## Scrapes the Oneills.com website to see the newest county vests on sale.<br><br>


Very simple program, very like the Daft Bot, that will scrape the oneills.ie website to find a specific type of vest.

If the vest is found an email is sent to the email specified in the config.txt file.

If it is not found, nothing happens.

Once finished the program sleeps for a specified amount of time.
